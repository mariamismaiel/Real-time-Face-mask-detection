# Real-time-Face-mask-detection
I worked on a real-time face mask detection project using deep learning techniques and achieved an impressive accuracy of 98% on the testing dataset. The objective was to develop a system that can accurately detect whether individuals are wearing masks or not in real-time scenarios.
